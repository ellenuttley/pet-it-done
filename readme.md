PetItDone is designed to merge the enjoyment and fun of gaming with the practicality of a to-do list. 

If you know you need an extra dose of urgency or that hit of dopamine you experience when gaming that traditional to-do lists seem to lack, then PetItDone is your perfect productivity companion. You have a lovable virtual pet that relies on you to meet its needs, and as you complete your tasks, you'll collect the necesary items to help make your pet happy again. It's a new, adorable, and rewarding way to stay motivated and productive.

Designed with accessibility at the forefront, to ensure an inclusive user experience. We have considered visual, motor, and cognitive accessibility needs. We used clear and legible fonts and choose color schemes that promoted an enjoyable user experience. Large, easy tappable buttons for motor accessibility were some of the other measures we took to promote accesibility throughtout our application. The language used is clear and concise for individuals with cognitive impairments. The task list feature has been designed to provide users with a manageable and fun experience, and users are limited to three tasks per day, ensuring they are not overwhelmed.
